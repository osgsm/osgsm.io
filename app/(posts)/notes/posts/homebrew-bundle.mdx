Homebrew Bundle は、 Homebrew や Homebrew Cask、 Mac App Store のためのバンドラ。

Brewfile というファイルに Homebrew 経由でインストールしたパッケージをリストアップし、そのファイルをもとに管理することができる。パソコンを新しくするときに、 Homebrew を使ってインストールしたパッケージを一括でインストールできるので便利。

すでに Homebrew を使ってパッケージをインストールしている場合、 `brew bundle dump` を実行すると Brewfile を作成できる。

```shell
brew bundle dump
```

例えば、次のような内容の `Brewfile` がカレントディレクトリに作成される。

```ini
tap "homebrew/bundle"
brew "node"
brew "git"
cask "figma"
cask "google-chrome"
```

この `Brewfile` ファイルを使ってアプリを管理することができる。

例えば、 `Brewfile` から特定のアプリ（この例では `figma`）を削除し...

``` ini
tap "homebrew/bundle"
brew "node"
brew "git"
cask "figma" # [!code --]
cask "google-chrome"
```

`brew bundle --cleanup` を実行すると、そのアプリがアンインストールされる。

逆に、 `Brewfile` に特定のアプリを追加し...

``` ini
tap "homebrew/bundle"
brew "node"
brew "git"
cask "figma" # [!code ++]
cask "google-chrome"
```

`brew bundle` を実行すると、そのアプリがインストールされる。

このように `Brewfile` にリストアップさえしておけば、一括でアプリをインストールできる。

ちなみに、Homebrew では、 macOS のアプリケーションや App Store のアプリケーションも管理できる。以下を参照。

- [mas-cli を使って Homebrew 経由で App Store のアプリケーションを管理する](/notes/homebrew-mas-cli)

```shell title="brew bundle --help"
Usage: brew bundle [subcommand]

Bundler for non-Ruby dependencies from Homebrew, Homebrew Cask, Mac App Store
and Whalebrew.

brew bundle [install]:
    Install and upgrade (by default) all dependencies from the Brewfile.

You can specify the Brewfile location using --file or by setting the
HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_FILE environment variable.

You can skip the installation of dependencies by adding space-separated values
to one or more of the following environment variables:
HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_BREW_SKIP, HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_CASK_SKIP,
HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_MAS_SKIP, HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_WHALEBREW_SKIP,
HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_TAP_SKIP.

brew bundle will output a Brewfile.lock.json in the same directory as the
Brewfile if all dependencies are installed successfully. This contains
dependency and system status information which can be useful in debugging brew
bundle failures and replicating a "last known good build" state. You can
opt-out of this behaviour by setting the HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_NO_LOCK environment
variable or passing the --no-lock option. You may wish to check this file into
the same version control system as your Brewfile (or ensure your version
control system ignores it if you'd prefer to rely on debugging information from
a local machine).

brew bundle dump:
    Write all installed casks/formulae/images/taps into a Brewfile in the
current directory.

brew bundle cleanup:
    Uninstall all dependencies not listed from the Brewfile.

This workflow is useful for maintainers or testers who regularly install lots of
formulae.

brew bundle check:
    Check if all dependencies are installed from the Brewfile.

This provides a successful exit code if everything is up-to-date, making it
useful for scripting.

brew bundle list:
    List all dependencies present in the Brewfile.

By default, only Homebrew dependencies are listed.

brew bundle exec command:
    Run an external command in an isolated build environment based on the
Brewfile dependencies.

This sanitized build environment ignores unrequested dependencies, which makes
sure that things you didn't specify in your Brewfile won't get picked up by
commands like bundle install, npm install, etc. It will also add compiler
flags which will help find keg-only dependencies like openssl, icu4c, etc.

      --file                       Read the Brewfile from this location. Use
                                   --file=- to pipe to stdin/stdout.
      --global                     Read the Brewfile from ~/.Brewfile.
  -v, --verbose                    install prints output from commands as they
                                   are run. check lists all missing
                                   dependencies.
      --no-upgrade                 install won't run brew upgrade on
                                   outdated dependencies. Note they may still be
                                   upgraded by brew install if needed.
  -f, --force                      dump overwrites an existing Brewfile.
                                   cleanup actually performs its cleanup
                                   operations.
      --cleanup                    install performs cleanup operation, same as
                                   running cleanup --force.
      --no-lock                    install won't output a
                                   Brewfile.lock.json.
      --all                        list all dependencies.
      --formula, --brews           list Homebrew dependencies.
      --cask, --casks              list Homebrew Cask dependencies.
      --tap, --taps                list tap dependencies.
      --mas                        list Mac App Store dependencies.
      --whalebrew                  list Whalebrew dependencies.
      --vscode                     list VSCode extensions.
      --describe                   dump adds a description comment above each
                                   line, unless the dependency does not have a
                                   description.
      --no-restart                 dump does not add restart_service to
                                   formula lines.
      --zap                        cleanup casks using the zap command
                                   instead of uninstall.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
```
